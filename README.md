# Andela Eats
The Andela Eats client side implementation

# Description
The Andela Eats is the software automation of the current feeding system so as to make it scalable through enabling access to all Andelans without Andela having to incur extra cost. The solution will also serve as a central place where all meal information is stored both for andelans and vendors. Vendors can manage meals and view feedback. Andelans can conveniently pre-order meals without the fear that a particular favourite meal is finished.
